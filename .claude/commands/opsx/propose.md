Propose a new change - create the change and generate all artifacts in one step.

I'll create a change with artifacts:
- proposal.md (what & why)
- design.md (how)
- tasks.md (implementation steps)

When ready to implement, run /opsx:apply

---

**Input**: The argument after `/opsx:propose` is the change name (kebab-case), OR a description of what the user wants to build.

**Steps**

1. **If no input provided, ask what they want to build**

   Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** (open-ended, no preset options) to ask:
   > "What change do you want to work on? Describe what you want to build or fix."

   From their description, derive a kebab-case name (e.g., "add user authentication" → `add-user-auth`).

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT proceed without understanding what the user wants to build.

2. **Create or reuse the change directory**
   ```bash
   openspec new change "<name>"
   ```
   This creates a scaffolded change in the planning home resolved by the CLI with `.openspec.yaml`.
   If the change already exists (e.g. `/opsx:probe` scaffolded it), reuse it instead of recreating.

2b. **Check for a probe report**
   Run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json` and look for `<changeRoot>/probe-report.md`.
   - **If absent**: print one line and continue (momentum is NOT affected):
     > No probe-report.md found. For deeper design alignment you can run `/opsx:probe <name>` first.
   - **If present**: read it fully. Treat its "Confirmed decisions" as explicit input for every artifact. You MUST copy each `[ASSUMED]` open assumption verbatim into proposal.md's `## Open Assumptions` section. Never silently absorb an assumption — assumptions stay visible to the user.

3. **Get the artifact build order**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```
   Parse the JSON to get:
   - `applyRequires`: array of artifact IDs needed before implementation (e.g., `["tasks"]`)
   - `artifacts`: list of all artifacts with their status and dependencies
   - `planningHome`, `changeRoot`, `artifactPaths`, and `actionContext`: path and scope context. Use these instead of assuming repo-local paths.

4. **Create artifacts in sequence until apply-ready**

   Use the **TodoWrite tool** to track progress through the artifacts.

   Loop through artifacts in dependency order (artifacts with no pending dependencies first):

   a. **For each artifact that is `ready` (dependencies satisfied)**:
      - Get instructions:
        ```bash
        openspec instructions <artifact-id> --change "<name>" --json
        ```
      - The instructions JSON includes:
        - `context`: Project background (constraints for you - do NOT include in output)
        - `rules`: Artifact-specific rules (constraints for you - do NOT include in output)
        - `template`: The structure to use for your output file
        - `instruction`: Schema-specific guidance for this artifact type
        - `resolvedOutputPath`: Resolved path or pattern to write the artifact
        - `dependencies`: Completed artifacts to read for context
      - Read any completed dependency files for context
      - Create the artifact file using `template` as the structure and write it to `resolvedOutputPath`
      - Apply `context` and `rules` as constraints - but do NOT copy them into the file
      - Show brief progress: "Created <artifact-id>"

   b. **Continue until all `applyRequires` artifacts are complete**
      - After creating each artifact, re-run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json`
      - Check if every artifact ID in `applyRequires` has `status: "done"` in the artifacts array
      - Stop when all `applyRequires` artifacts are done

   c. **If an artifact requires user input** (unclear context):
      - Use **AskUserQuestion tool** to clarify
      - Then continue with creation

5. **Confirm open assumptions — reverse declaration, one question at a time**

   Collect every `[ASSUMED]` decision into proposal.md's `## Open Assumptions` section (create the section even when no probe-report.md exists):
   - items carried verbatim from probe-report.md, plus
   - every decision you made during artifact creation without user confirmation (scope cuts, capability boundaries, task ordering, naming, defaults).

   Then walk the list with the user, probe-style:
   - **One question per assumption, one at a time**, using the **AskUserQuestion tool** with preset options: your recommended answer first, marked "(Recommended)", with evidence (a spec, `status --json`, a source file:line, or an explicit "general assumption, unverified"), and the plausible alternatives as the other options.
   - **Self-contained questions**: artifacts are machine-facing — the user will NOT open them. Each question must carry everything needed to decide inline: the assumption, the evidence, and what changes downstream if it is overturned.
   - **Write back immediately**: after each answer, patch every affected artifact before asking the next question. A confirmed assumption becomes a decision recorded in proposal.md; an overturned one means you rework the affected artifacts now — never defer the edit.
   - **Bounded**: ask each assumption exactly once. Do not re-open intent or scope already settled (that is `/opsx:probe`'s job), and do not re-review artifacts wholesale after patching.
   - **Escape hatch**: if the user says "enough" / "use your recommendations" / "your call", keep the remaining items as `[ASSUMED]` lines in `## Open Assumptions` and finish.

6. **Show final status**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>"
   ```

**Output**

After completing all artifacts, summarize:
- Change name and location
- List of artifacts created with brief descriptions
- Assumptions: how many were confirmed/overturned in step 5, and any that remain `[ASSUMED]`
- What's ready: "All artifacts created! Ready for implementation."
- Prompt: "Run `/opsx:apply` to start implementing."

**Artifact Creation Guidelines**

- Follow the `instruction` field from `openspec instructions` for each artifact type
- The schema defines what each artifact should contain - follow it
- Read dependency artifacts for context before creating new ones
- Use `template` as the structure for your output file - fill in its sections
- **IMPORTANT**: `context` and `rules` are constraints for YOU, not content for the file
  - Do NOT copy `<context>`, `<rules>`, `<project_context>` blocks into the artifact
  - These guide what you write, but should never appear in the output
- proposal.md MUST contain a `## Open Assumptions` section — every `[ASSUMED]` item from probe-report.md (if present) plus every unconfirmed decision you made while drafting. Carrying assumptions forward visibly is required — do not drop or silently resolve them.

**Guardrails**
- Create ALL artifacts needed for implementation (as defined by schema's `apply.requires`)
- Always read dependency artifacts before creating a new one
- If context is critically unclear, ask the user - but prefer making reasonable decisions to keep momentum; record every such decision as `[ASSUMED]` so step 5 surfaces it
- If a change with that name already exists, ask if user wants to continue it or create a new one
- Verify each artifact file exists after writing before proceeding to next
